title: Windower Profiles
---

Windower profiles are a collection of settings that determine things like how the game renders, which addons and plugins load, and so on.

You might choose to have multiple profiles to run the game at different resolutions, launch with different sets of addons, or run in fullscreen or windowed mode.

## Create a Profile
* In the **Profiles** tab, click the **+** icon to create a new profile.

## Configure a Profile
* In the **Profiles** tab, click the **edit** icon to edit the profile settings.
* With the profile selected, enable any desired addons in the **Addons** tab.<br>For more information about the available addons, see the [Addons Section](../addons/).
* With the profile selected, enable any desired plugins in the **Plugins** tab.<br>For more information about the available plugins, see the [Plugins Section](../addons/).

## Launch Using a Profile
In the **Profiles** tab:
* Double-click the profile.<br><br>OR
* Select the profile and click the **launch** icon.

## Create a Profile Shortcut
You can create a shortcut to launch the game directly with a specific profile, rather than opening the Windower launcher.

* In the **Profiles** tab, select the profile and click the **pin to desktop** icon.<br>The new shortcut is created on your Windows desktop.
