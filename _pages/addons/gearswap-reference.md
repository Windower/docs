|precast(spell,position)|Passes the resources line for the spell with a few modifications. Occurs immediately before the outgoing action packet is injected. cancel_spell(), verify_equip(), force_send(), and cast_delay() are implemented in this phase. Does not occur for items that bypass the outgoing text buffer (like using items from the menu).|
|midcast(spell)|Passes the resources line for the spell with a few modifications. Occurs immediately after the outgoing action packet is injected. Does not occur for items that bypass the outgoing text buffer (like using items from the menu).|
|aftercast(spell)|Passes the resources line for the spell with a few modifications. Occurs when the "result" action packet is received from the server, or an interruption of some kind is detected.|
|status_change(new,old)|Passes the new and old statuses.|
|pet_change(pet,gain)|Passes in the "pet" table and a boolean indicating whether the pet is being summoned (true) or dismissed (false). Order is not guaranteed relative to aftercast for JAs like Release or Leave.|

## GearSwap Functions

### set_combine

```lua
set_combine(set1, set2, ...)
```

Combines an arbitrary number of sets and returns the resulting set, giving right-most sets slot priority.

### equip

```lua
equip(set1, set2, set3, ...)
```

Builds a set to be equipped. Slot priority is given to the last set (collapses the sets from right to left). If two equip commands are used, the latter one has slot priority over the first.

### change_target

```lua
change_target(new target)
```

Changes the target to whatever value is passed. It can be a name or something like `<t>`, but be aware that there will be no correction done on it. Valid only in pretarget.
